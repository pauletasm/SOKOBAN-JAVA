Last year I had to re-create the game Sokoban as the final project of my Object-oriented programming class, in Java.
My game is based on the same concept of the original one, but has MUCH more features, such as:
-Portals
-Icy floor
-Batery
-Holes
-Scoreboards
and much more.
I also added new looks and textures in order to look more appealing.
